;roughness multiplier can be used to compensate for different reflection texture resolutions
;it is used in the calculation for mip map level selection, higher values will result in more
;roughness (less smoothness) because of mip map level selection of higher levels
;to get approximately the same roughness for double the reflection texture resolution you have
;to double this value
